Files and Data Models
---------------------
The BAL catalogs with updated redshifts for Fuji (EDR) can be found at [https://data.desi.lbl.gov/public/edr/vac/lsdr9-photometry/fuji/v2.0](https://data.desi.lbl.gov/public/edr/vac/bal-masked-redshift/fuji-v1.0)

DESI Collaborators can access these files at /global/cfs/cdirs/desi/public/edr/vac/bal-masked-redshift/fuji-v1.0

The VAC files contain catalogs of BALs that have had their absorption features masked. The BALs were then run through Paul Martini's [baltools] (https://github.com/paulmartini/baltools) to create the catalogs.

Our VAC contains two catalogs which are described in more detail in the table below.
